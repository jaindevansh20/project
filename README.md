ðŸŽ® C++ Console Game Collection
This is a C++ console-based application that includes three simple interactive games:
Rock, Paper, Scissors â€“ A classic game where the player competes against the computer using random move generation.
Seven Up Seven Down â€“ A dice-based betting game where the user guesses whether the sum of two dice will be 7 (Up) or not (Down).
Guess the Number â€“ A number guessing game with three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), each limiting the number of allowed guesses.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Menu-driven interface
Random number generation using rand() and srand()
Game logic implemented with switch, if-else, and loops
Input validation and replay options for each game

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
C++
Standard Libraries: <iostream>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced
Control Structures: if-else, switch, do-while loops
Random Number Generation: Using srand(time(0)) and rand() for unpredictability
User Input Handling and basic validation
Loop-based Replay System for continuous interaction
Menu-Driven Program Structure for cleaner user experience

ðŸ“š What I Learned
This project helped reinforce my understanding of C++ fundamentals including control structures, functions, randomness, and user interaction in a command-line environment. It also provided hands-on experience in organizing multiple games within a single application.
